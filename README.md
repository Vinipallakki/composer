# ETL Pipeline using Dataproc, GCS, and BigQuery

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts sales data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), processes it using a PySpark job running on Google Cloud Dataproc, and loads the processed data into a BigQuery table.

## Overview

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Load raw sales data from a CSV file stored in GCS.
2. **Data Transformation**: Process the data using PySpark on a Dataproc cluster, which includes cleaning the data and performing necessary transformations.
3. **Data Loading**: Load the processed data into a BigQuery table for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A **Google Cloud Project** with billing enabled.
- Google Cloud services such as **GCS**, **Dataproc**, **BigQuery**, and **Cloud Composer** enabled.
- An **Airflow environment** (Google Cloud Composer) configured.
- A **Dataproc cluster** set up to run the PySpark job.

## Steps to Set Up and Run the Pipeline

### 1. Set Up GCS Bucket
- Create a **Google Cloud Storage bucket** to store the raw data (sales CSV files) and the processed data.
- Upload the raw sales data CSV file to the GCS bucket.

### 2. Set Up BigQuery
- Create a **BigQuery dataset** in your Google Cloud project.
- Create an empty **BigQuery table** where the processed data will be loaded.
  - Ensure that the schema matches the expected output of the transformation (e.g., category, total value).

### 3. Create a Dataproc Cluster
- Set up a **Dataproc cluster** in your project to run the PySpark transformation job.
  - The cluster should be located in the same region as your other resources (e.g., `us-central1`).

### 4. Write the PySpark Job
- Develop a **PySpark job** to perform data cleaning and aggregation.
  - The job will read the raw data from GCS, perform transformations, and write the processed data back to GCS.
- Upload the PySpark job script to your GCS bucket.

### 5. Configure the Airflow DAG
- Create an **Airflow DAG** that orchestrates the ETL pipeline.
  - The DAG should define the following tasks:
    1. Create the destination BigQuery table (if it doesn't already exist).
    2. Submit the Dataproc job to process the data.
    3. Load the processed data from GCS into the BigQuery table.
  
### 6. Deploy the DAG to Cloud Composer
- Upload the **Airflow DAG** file to the **DAGs folder** in your Cloud Composer environment.
- Cloud Composer will automatically detect the DAG, and it will be visible in the Airflow UI.

### 7. Run the Pipeline
- From the Airflow UI, trigger the DAG to run the pipeline.
- The pipeline will automatically execute the ETL process:
  1. The raw sales data is extracted from GCS.
  2. The PySpark job on Dataproc transforms the data.
  3. The transformed data is loaded into the BigQuery table.

### 8. Monitor the Workflow
- Monitor the execution of the DAG through the Airflow UI.
- Review logs for each task to ensure the pipeline runs smoothly.
  - Logs can also be viewed through Google Cloud Logging for more detailed diagnostics in case of failure.

## Conclusion

This ETL pipeline provides a structured process to handle data ingestion, transformation, and loading using Google Cloud's suite of services. It can be adapted to handle more complex transformations and additional data sources.
